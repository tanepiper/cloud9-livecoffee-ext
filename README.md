Cloud9 Live CoffeeScript Extension (fork on PragTob)
====================================================

This live CoffeeScript extension for Cloud9 provides a window view of the live
formatted JavaScript output of a CoffeeScript file as you type.

The window provided has the option to view the output with bare compiling (i.e
not closure) on or off via a checkbox.

Installation
------------

This extension currently only works with self-hosted copies of Cloud9 (either via
cloning `https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9` or `npm install cloud9`).  Third-party
extensions are not supported on c9.io. As Cloud9 is rapidly involving it is however 
recommended to use the cloud9 version this plugin was last tested with, which 
can be found at [our fork](https://github.com/PragTob/cloud9). Then you should
do:

    git clone git://github.com/PragTob/cloud9-livecoffee-ext.git cloud9/plugins-client/ext.livecoffee

Open the `Tools -> Extension Manager` window, put the path to the extension in

    ext/livecoffee/livecoffee

Click add.  You can now view the window via the Edit menu.

Options
-------

* Approx Line Match: During compile, the live view will match the line number of
the file you are working on. This is an approximate match of the code output
location. When the livecoffee window is open, matching blocks of CoffeeScript
and JavaScript are also automatically highlighted as you click in the source
code. The approximate line matching is provided thanks to the [CoffeeScriptLineMatcher project](https://github.com/showell/CoffeeScriptLineMatcher)

* Compile Bare: Compile the output without the surrounding closure

* Compile Nodes: Enable the nodes tab and output the node structure of the code

* Compile Tokens: Enable the tokens tab and output the tokens from the lexer

Shortcut Keys & Command
-----------------------
This extension comes with the `livecoffee` command that you can type into the
command area to launch the window.

You can also add shortcut keys to your `ext/keybindings_default` files.  Edit
`default_win.js` or `default_mac.js` depending on your platform.  To enable
it add the following:

    return keys.onLoad({
        "ext" : {
            "livecoffee": {
                "livecoffee": "Ctrl-Shift-K"   
            }
        }
    })

For the Mac, use `Command-Option-K`, or choose your own key shortcuts.
